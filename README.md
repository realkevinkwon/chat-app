## Instructions for Local Deployment

### Setup

#### Prerequisites

You must have Node.js and npm installed to deploy this web app:
- Install [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

#### Starting the server

From the `server` directory:
- Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the server with `npm start`

#### Starting the client

From the `client` directory:
- Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
- Start the client with `npm start`

#### Launching the app

After running `npm start` in the `client` directory,
the web app should launch automatically.

Otherwise, open the web app by visiting [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Configuration

#### Configure the server port

Edit `SERVER_PORT` in `server/server.js`
```js
const SERVER_PORT = 8080;
```

and `SERVER_PORT` in `client/src/App.js`
```js
const SERVER_PORT = 8080;
const socket = io(`http://localhost:${SERVER_PORT}`);
```

#### Configure the client port

Edit `CLIENT_PORT` in `server/server.js`
```js
const CLIENT_PORT = 3000;
```

and `PORT` in `client/package.json`
```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "start": "PORT=3000 react-scripts start",
    },
}
```

    |-|

#### Chats saved between logins
- Users will be able to view previous messages if they join later
- Messages persist between logins &mdash; 
letting users who leave and rejoin continue where they left off

#### Material Design
- Clean design that follows Google's [Material Design](#mui-material-ui) through the use of MUI

#### [Client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model)

- Clients connect to a server which handles communication between clients
- Server keeps track of users, chats, and messages which allows users
to continue where they left off when they rejoin

## Technologies

### Front-end

#### [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)

- Provides framework for building user interfaces
- Serve dynamic content without reloading the whole page for every change

#### [MUI (Material UI)](https://mui.com/)

- A third-party React.js component library
- Add custom React.js components that follow Google's
[Material Design](https://m3.material.io/) principles

### Back-end

#### [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

- General web application framework for structuring the app

#### [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)

- Handles connections between client and server
- Better performance than simply using back-and-forth HTTP requests
